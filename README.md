# JSON to Table converter, with formatting

Simple features:
- Accepts any JSON format and converts it into a table, with each line representing one row. Each nested object is displayed with its properties on separate lines.
- Color-coded: blue for strings and red for numbers.
- Alternating row colors for better readability.

(I couldn't find an online tool that does this, so I decided to create one myself.)
